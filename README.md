# Machine-Learning-

I wrote different python codes for different tasks i.e Task1.py, Task2.py and Task3.py for Task1, Task2 and Task3 respectively.
In zipped folder, there are 2 folders namely "src" and "data"
All codes are present in "src" folder
We can run codes in "src" folder and the working directory should also be "src"
In "data" folder, there are 5 files namely 
i)   "winequality-red.csv" which is the given data for reading
ii)  "DataSet_A.csv" which represents DataSet A
iii) "DataSetB.csv" which represents DataSet B
iv) "ResultFile_for_Task2.txt" which contains all coefficients of self written Logistic Regression using the entire data as Training Data and mean accuracy, precision, recall for both the classifiers.
v)  "ResultFile_for_Task3.txt" which contains mean accuracy, precision, recall for both theself written Decision Tree and scikit learn Decision Tree.
