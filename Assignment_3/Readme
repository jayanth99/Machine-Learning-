Name   : Jayanth Harsha Gorantla
Roll No. : 17CS10013


I wrote different python codes for different tasks i.e TaskA.py, TaskB.py, TaskC.py, TaskD.py and TaskE.py for TaskA, TaskB, TaskC, TaskD and TaskE respectively.

In zipped folder, there are 3 folders namely "src", "data" and “clusters”
All codes are present in "src" folder
We can run codes in "src" folder and the working directory should also be "src"

In "data" folder, there are 3 files namely 
i)   "AllBooks_baseline_DTM_Labelled.csv" which is the given data
ii)  "tfIdf_DataSet.csv" which represents DataSet obtained after Task A
iii) "ResultFile_for_TaskE.txt" which contains NMI scores for all four clusters


NMI scores :

NMI score for Agglomerative clustering before applying PCA : 0.03437144602305066
NMI score for Agglomerative clustering after applying PCA    :  0.03437144602305066
NMI score for K means clustering before applying PCA          : 0.3801730601108964
NMI score for Agglomerative clustering after applying PCA     : 0.5987347400970148
